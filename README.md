# Frontend Development Test

## Instructions
1. From the root directory run `npm install` to install node_modules folder.
2. Run `webpack` to create bundle.js file.
3. Host a local server from the root directory (I suggest `http-server`) and
   and visit your localhost on your browser (http://localhost:8080 if using
   `http-server`).
4. The articles can be sorted by 'words' and 'submitted' parameters by
   clicking on the header titles labeled 'WORDS' and 'SUBMITTED' respectively.
